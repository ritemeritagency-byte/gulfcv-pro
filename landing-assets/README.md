Landing page image folder.

Use this file path for the hero photo:

- `landing-assets/hero-design.png`

On macOS:

1. Open Finder.
2. Go to this project folder.
3. Open `landing-assets`.
4. Replace `hero-design.png` with your own image.
5. Keep the filename as `hero-design.png` so no code changes are needed.
